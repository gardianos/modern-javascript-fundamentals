 * JavaScript also supports two additional types of loops: while and do .. while loops. These loops differ from  *
 * for loops in that they test a condition evaluating to true or false at each iteration step, rather than       *
 * iterating a range of numbers or elements in an object. Weâ€™ll cover the syntax of both while loop types and    *
 * look at some considerations of their usage.                                                                   *
 * Syntax: while, do                                                                                             *
